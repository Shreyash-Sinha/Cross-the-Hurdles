# Cross-the-Hurdles
This is a basic game created in python using the pygame module

# Basic Overview
This game is made completely in python using the pygame module. It took me almost 4 hours to complete this project. In this game there is a ball on the top of the screen and rectangular
obstacles arecoming in between the ball. You need to cross those hurdles if you want to win. There is a score board which displays the current score of the user. The ball can be
controlled by using the Left and Right Arrow keys.

# Run
If you want to run this code, you need to download the folder named Cross the hurdles and open it. Then you need to open Windows Powershell or Windows Command Prompt inside the folder. 
Then you need to type 'python .\main.py' and this will run the program and you can play the game.
